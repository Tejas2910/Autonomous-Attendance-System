# Autonomous-Attendance-System
RFID based-autonomous attendance system for student tracking in any course

1. Designed and implemented a comprehensive Autonomous Attendance System for student tracking in any course.
2. Configured RFID readers with TIVA C microcontrollers using the SPI protocol, storing data in EEPROM.
3. Created an efficient registration system for ID cards, storing student roll numbers and course codes within RFID tags.
4. Enabled real-time attendance updates on a TFT screen connected to TIVA via SPI, and developed a scalable, cost-effective method to sync attendance data with Google Sheets using the ESP01 Wi-Fi module.
