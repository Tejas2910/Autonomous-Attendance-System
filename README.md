# Autonomous-Attendance-System
RFID based-autonomous attendance system for student tracking in any course

Project Details:
 - Designed and implemented a comprehensive Autonomous Attendance System for student tracking in any course.
 - Configured RFID readers with TIVA C microcontrollers using the SPI protocol, storing data in EEPROM.
 - Created an efficient registration system for ID cards, storing student roll numbers and course codes within RFID tags.
 - Enabled real-time attendance updates on a TFT screen connected to TIVA via SPI, and developed a scalable, cost-effective
   method to sync attendance data with Google Sheets using the ESP01 Wi-Fi module.
